                I did my undergraduate studies at the University Of Cape Town, studying Bachelor of Science,
                specializing in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.<br/>
                The main aspects of the degree, that I learnt form the Computer Science Side, was the basics of Python
                and Java, Data Structures and algorithms, Software Engineering and Theory of Algorithms and
                Computation, <br/>
                whilst on the Computer Engineering Side, I learnt aspects of Electrical Engineering, as well as
                programming STM boards and RaspberryPi Boards using C and C++, as well as Machine and Reinforcement
